"""
Event Reports Management Module for Workday Strategic Sourcing API Simulation.

This module provides functionality for managing and retrieving event reports
in the Workday Strategic Sourcing system. It supports operations for accessing
report entries, retrieving specific report data, and managing report schemas.
The module enables users to track and analyze event-related data through
comprehensive reporting capabilities.
