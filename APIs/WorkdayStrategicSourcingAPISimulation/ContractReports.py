"""
Contract Reports Management Module for Workday Strategic Sourcing API Simulation.

This module provides functionality for managing and retrieving contract reports
in the Workday Strategic Sourcing system. It supports operations for accessing
contract report entries and their associated schema definitions. The module
enables comprehensive contract tracking and reporting capabilities.

    This function returns all contract report entries currently stored in the

    include detailed information about contracts, their status, and associated
    metrics.

    Returns:
        List[Dict]: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a
            contract report entry containing:
            - contract_id (int): Unique identifier of the contract

            - start_date (str): Contract start date
            - end_date (str): Contract end date
            - total_value (float): Total contract value
            - currency (str): Currency of the contract value
            - created_at (str): Timestamp of contract creation
            - updated_at (str): Timestamp of last update
            - metrics (Dict): Contract-specific performance metrics

    Note:
        If no contract report entries exist in the system, an empty list is
        returned. The returned data is read-only and should not be modified

    This function returns the complete schema definition that describes the

    defines the data model and constraints for contract report creation and
