Supplier Company Contacts Management Module

This module provides functionality for managing contacts associated with supplier
companies in the Workday Strategic Sourcing system. It supports operations for
retrieving and filtering contacts for a specific supplier company.

The module interfaces with the simulation database to provide comprehensive contact
management capabilities, allowing users to:
- Retrieve all contacts for a specific supplier company
- Filter contacts based on specific criteria
- Include related resources in the response

        filter (Optional[Dict[str, Any]], default=None): Dictionary of field-value pairs to filter contacts.
            Each key represents a field to match, and its value is the required value.
